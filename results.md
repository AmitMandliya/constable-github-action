### Analysis

* We asked our subjects to rate importance of each factor that is currently tracked by Constable on a scale of 1 to 5. We then normalized the scores of each subject and finally plotted the value on a scale of 1 to 10. Doing this helped us to compare the weights which Constable is currently using with the weights assigned by the subjects.

  Here is a comparison of weights assigned by Constable and the mean of weights assigned by the subjects:

  | Attribute               | Weight Assigned by Constable | Mean of Weights Assigned by Subjects |
