### Analysis

* We asked our subjects to rate importance of each factor that is currently tracked by Constable on a scale of 1 to 5. We then normalized the scores of each subject and finally plotted the value on a scale of 1 to 10. Doing this helped us to compare the weights which Constable is currently using with the weights assigned by the subjects.

  Here is a comparison of weights assigned by Constable and the mean of weights assigned by the subjects:

  | Attribute               | Weight Assigned by Constable | Mean of Weights Assigned by Subjects |
  |-------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
  | README.md               | 2                            | 1.6                                  |
  | CONTRIBUTING.md         | 1                            | 1.2                                  |
  | CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md      | 0.5                          | 1                                    |
  | License                 | 1                            | 1.3                                  |
  | Citation                | 0.5                          | 1.1                                  |
  | .gitignore              | 1                            | 1.3                                  |
  | Avg. PR Closing Time    | 2                            | 1.1                                  |
  | Avg. Issue Closing Time | 2                            | 1.1                                  |
